## Data Science Internship Opportunities at Flytxt R&D (December 2022)
We are looking for self-motivated individuals with a passion to solve real-world problems in emerging areas of machine learning/AI including federated privacy preserving machine learning and explainable AI. You will be responsible to design, code, test and deploy PoCs which demonstrate the value in applying these advanced techniques on usecases in customer experience management. You would be working in a fast-paced environment, and would need to pick up concepts through a combination of self-learning and your assigned mentor's guidance. Please note that this will be a remote internship program.

## Who can apply?
1. Students in 3rd/4th year B.Tech program in Computer Science or a related discipline (Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Electrical and/or Computer Engineering) with a focus on Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning. Final year M.Tech/MS/Ph.D students from the above disciplines are also eligible.
2. Should be passionate about advanced machine learning/AI.
3. Should be able to devote a minimum of 2 months, starting December 2022

## Problem Description
This year, we have two problems from which you can choose **one**

### Problem 1: Explainable AI based on causal reasoning
#### Backdrop:
Churn models predict customers who are likely to leave, but do not generally answer why. This limits actionability and reduces marketer’s trust on the model’s predictions due to lack of explanations.

#### Goal:
Create an explainable churn prediction model which: 
Visualizes causal structure in observed data along with strength of each causal factor towards churn. The visualization should convey which factors contribute to customer churn and to what extent, at an overall level. 

Predicts if a specific user will churn along with the top-3 contributing factors for that user to churn. A visual explanation for the model’s specific prediction should be provided.

Model for the overall causal structure visualization should be built using CausalNex, an open-source project from McKinsey (https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/causalnex). The learned causal model should be used to predict if a specific user is likely to churn. To identify top-3 contributing factors and to generate the visual explanation for each prediction, SHAP (https://github.com/slundberg/shap) should be used.

#### Success Criteria:
Prediction accuracy of the causal model should be comparable to that of a baseline model based on Random Forest.
Domain expert's validation of the learned causal structure; subjective evaluation of causes for churn on a random subset of cases
Brownie points for setting up an interactive demo of the model on a public cloud, covering the following functionality:
User uploads a churn dataset
Gets a causal structure visualization which he/she can edit.
KPI values for a particular user are entered to get a prediction along with top-3 contributing factors and a visual explanation for the predicted outcome

## Application Process
1. Interested candidates should choose <ins>**one**</ins> problem from the above list of problems and prepare a <ins>**1 page**</ins> proposal describing their approach and key milestones. Please note that the proposal should clearly state how <ins>**you**</ins> would approach the problem and the <ins>**corresponding work breakdown structure along with a timeline.**</ins> **Proposals exceeding 1 page and/or which are very generic will not be considered.**
